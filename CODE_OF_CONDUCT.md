# [Naturalistic Ethical Guidelines](https://github.com/ninlith/naturalistic-ethical-guidelines)

## Maxim
Act consequentialistically and try to minimize (intense) suffering.

## Rationale
Contra-causal free will is logically incoherent and retributive moral responsibility is unethical in any case. Neither any non-suffering nor lack of it appear to be in itself ethically problematic.

## Some general rules of thumb
* Allow eccentricity and difference of opinion.
* Aim for kindness and equality of outcome.
* Refrain from identity politics and safetyism.
* Avoid omission bias, wishful thinking and appeal to nature.
* Take Russellian monism seriously.
